                <p>Our assignment was to create a general customer journey for grocery stores. The first step was doing research and creating a persona for the chosen target group .This phase of the process included both quantitive and qualitative research. After creating a persona the research phase included user-observations. When the observations had been conducted we created a customer journey based on these.</p>

        <p class="agile">In this projects and for the majority of all the other projects in this portfolio we worked agile in our teams. This particular project was short and therefore only one sprint. Our team used trello as a way of adding more structure into defining and dividing all the different tasks that needed to be done in the project. We had daily stand-ups every day and at the end of the sprint, a retrospective.</p>

                <p>The first step of this project was to create a simple persona for our chosen target group, which was people with a limited economical budget. To do this we made a survey with google forms and collected responses form 15 people, which gave us a lot of information to create a persona. We asked questions regarding personal demographical facts, their grocery shopping habits and their typical grocery store in order to get a deeper understanding of their needs,  motivations and frustrations.</p>

                <p class="overview-text">Personas are a great tool for gaining empathy and an understanding for the user. However, they are not always super helpful for a UX-designer in themselves, since they mostly provide demographic facts and not a lot of information regarding user behavior. By complementing a persona with a customer journey you gain a lot more insight into how the user interacts and behaves in a realistic setting, which is very useful for both a UX-designer and other parties of a company.</p>
